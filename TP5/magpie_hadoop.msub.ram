# Set how the filesystem should be setup
#
# "hdfs" - Normal straight up HDFS if you have local disk in your
#          cluster.  This option is primarily for benchmarking and
#          probably shouldn't be used in the general case.
#
#          Be careful running this in a cluster environment.  The next
#          time you execute your job, if a different set of nodes are
#          allocated to you, the HDFS data you wrote from a previous
#          job may not be there.  Specifying specific nodes to use in
#          your job submission (e.g. --nodelist in sbatch) may be a
#          way to alleviate this.
#
#          User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH below.
#
# "hdfsoverlustre" - HDFS over Lustre.  See README for description.
#
#                    User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH below. 
#
# "hdfsovernetworkfs" - HDFS over Network FS.  Identical to HDFS over
#                       Lustre, but filesystem agnostic.
#
#                       User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERNETWORKFS_PATH below.
#
# "rawnetworkfs" - Use Hadoop RawLocalFileSystem (i.e. file: scheme),
#           to use networked file system directly.  It could be a
#           Lustre mount or NFS mount.  Whatever you please.

# If you want to specify multiple paths (such as multiple drives),
